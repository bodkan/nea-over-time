# _"The limits of long-term selection against Neandertal introgression"_

This repository contains source code and Jupyter notebooks for data processing,
simulations and analyses used in [this]() paper.

To reproduce everything from scratch, you'll need to install all dependencies
listed bellow.

Full disclosure: I've been lucky enough to have huge computational
resources at my disposal (60 core machine with 1 TB RAM and computational
cluster with hundreds of nodes) and I often used them to their full potential.
Unless you have similar resources, then it's not trivial to truly reproduce
everything from scratch. I will do my best to figure out a way to share
the results of all simulations (a couple of hundreds of gigabytes), to make
it possible to reproduce the final results and plots without re-running the
whole simulation pipeline.

## Python

I used Python version 3.6.5 and the following Python modules:

```
pip install numpy pandas msprime pybedtools jupyter
```

## R

I used R version 3.4.3.

Packages from CRAN:
```
install.packages(c("broom", "forcats", "future", "ggbeeswarm", "ggrepel",
                   "here", "latex2exp", "magrittr", "Metrics", "modelr",
                   "parallel", "purrr", "stringr", "tidyverse"))
```

Packages from Bioconductor:
```
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("biomaRt", "VariantAnnotation", "BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19",
           "GenomicRanges",  "rtracklayer"))
```

Packages from GitHub:
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thomasp85/patchwork")
devtools::install_github("bodkan/bdkn")
devtools::install_github("bodkan/slimr", ref = "v0.1")
devtools::install_github("bodkan/admixr", ref = "v0.1")
```

To be able to run Jupyter notebooks that contain all my analses and figures,
you will also need to install [IRkernel](https://irkernel.github.io).

## SLiM

I used SLiM v2.6. Be aware that SLiM introduced some backwards incompatible
changes since its 2.0 release, so make sure to use exactly version 2.6.

## HOWTO

In principle, different notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory use different data
generated by "pipeline scripts" in the root of the repository (`00_...sh`, `01_...sh`, etc.).
However, there's no strict sequential order of executing everything. In fact, I ran those
scripts mostly by pieces, adding additional commands as the project developed, and analyzed new
data as they were being generated.
